# Swarm-Soccer-Robot
My first design while still in school

I wanted to have a place to store the old code and design files for the Swarm robot that I created while still in engineering
school. It worked out pretty well, but the control system that was to be designed by other members of the team was never
completed, unfortunately, so I don't know how well it might have done in an actual competition.

The PCB design files are Eagle format.
